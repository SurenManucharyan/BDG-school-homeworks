Part 1 – Fetch from 2 APIs
Create an async function that:

Fetches all countries from "https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=name,population,region"

Fetches 10 cat facts from https://catfact.ninja/facts?limit=10

Use Promise.all() to run both fetches in parallel.



Part 2 – Data Manipulation
After getting the data:
Countries:
Filter out only countries from Europe.

Sort the countries by population (descending).

Create a new array of objects with only:
{
  name: "France",
  population: 67000000,
  region: "Europe"
}


Cat Facts:
Filter only facts longer than 50 characters.

Count how many facts are over 100 characters long.

Map them into this format:
{
  fact: "Cats are awesome...",
  length: 93
}
